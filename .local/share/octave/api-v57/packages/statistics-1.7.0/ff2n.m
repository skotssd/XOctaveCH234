## Two-level full factorial design.
##
## @code{@var{dFF2} = ff2n (@var{n})} gives factor settings dFF2 for a two-level
## full factorial design with n factors.  @var{dFF2} is m-by-n, where m is the
## number of treatments in the full-factorial design.  Each row of @var{dFF2}
## corresponds to a single treatment.  Each column contains the settings for a
## single factor, with values of 0 and 1 for the two levels.
