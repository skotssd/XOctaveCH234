     Estimate parameters and confidence intervals for the Beta
     distribution.

     ‘PARAMHAT = betafit (X)’ returns the maximum likelihood estimates
     of the parameters of the Beta distribution given the data in vector
     X.  PARAMHAT([1, 2]) corresponds to the α and β shape parameters,
     respectively.  Missing values, NaNs, are ignored.

     ‘[PARAMHAT, PARAMCI] = betafit (X)’ returns the 95% confidence
     intervals for the parameter estimates.

     ‘[...] = betafit (X, ALPHA)’ also returns the 100 * (1 - ALPHA)
     percent confidence intervals of the estimated parameter.  By
     default, the optional argument ALPHA is 0.05 corresponding to 95%
     confidence intervals.

     ‘[...] = betafit (PARAMS, X, FREQ)’ accepts a frequency vector,
     FREQ, of the same size as X.  FREQ must contain non-negative
     integer frequencies for the corresponding elements in X.  By
     default, or if left empty, FREQ = ones (size (X)).

     ‘[PARAMHAT, PARAMCI] = nbinfit (X, ALPHA, OPTIONS)’ specifies
     control parameters for the iterative algorithm used to compute ML
     estimates with the ‘fminsearch’ function.  OPTIONS is a structure
     with the following fields and their default values:
        • OPTIONS.Display = "off"
        • OPTIONS.MaxFunEvals = 400
        • OPTIONS.MaxIter = 200
        • OPTIONS.TolX = 1e-6

     The Beta distribution is defined on the open interval (0,1).
     However, ‘betafit’ can also compute the unbounded beta likelihood
     function for data that include exact zeros or ones.  In such cases,
     zeros and ones are treated as if they were values that have been
     left-censored at sqrt (realmin) or right-censored at 1 - eps/2,
     respectively.

 -- statistics: NLOGL = betalike (PARAMS, X)
 -- statistics: [NLOGL, AVAR] = betalike (PARAMS, X)

     Negative log-likelihood for the Beta distribution.

     ‘NLOGL = betalike (PARAMS, X)’ returns the negative log likelihood
     of the data in X corresponding to the Beta distribution with (1)
     shape parameter α and (2) shape parameter β given in the
     two-element vector PARAMS.  Both parameters must be positive real
     numbers and the data in the range [0,1].  Out of range parameters
     or data return NaN.

     ‘[NLOGL, AVAR] = betalike (PARAMS, X)’ returns the inverse of
     Fisher’s information matrix, AVAR.  If the input parameter values
     in PARAMS are the maximum likelihood estimates, the diagonal
     elements of PARAMS are their asymptotic variances.

     ‘[...] = betalike (PARAMS, X, FREQ)’ accepts a frequency vector,
     FREQ, of the same size as X.  FREQ must contain non-negative
     integer frequencies for the corresponding elements in X.  By
     default, or if left empty, FREQ = ones (size (X)).

 -- statistics: PSHAT = binofit (X, N)

 -- statistics: [PSHAT, PSCI] = binofit (X, N, ALPHA)

     Estimate parameter and confidence intervals for the binomial
     distribution.

     ‘PSHAT = binofit (X, N)’ returns the maximum likelihood estimate
     (MLE) of the probability of success for the binomial distribution.
     X and N are scalars containing the number of successes and the
     number of trials, respectively.  If X and N are vectors, ‘binofit’
     returns a vector of estimates whose i-th element is the parameter
     estimate for X(i) and N(i).  A scalar value for X or N is expanded
     to the same size as the other input.

     ‘[PSHAT, PSCI] = binofit (X, N, ALPHA)’ also returns the 100 * (1 -
     ALPHA) percent confidence intervals of the estimated parameter.  By
     default, the optional argument ALPHA is 0.05 corresponding to 95%
     confidence intervals.

     ‘binofit’ treats a vector X as a collection of measurements from
     separate samples, and returns a vector of estimates.  If you want
     to treat X as a single sample and compute a single parameter
     estimate and confidence interval, use binofit (sum (X), sum (N))
     when N is a vector, and binofit (sum (X), N * length (X)) when N is
     a scalar.

     Negative log-likelihood for the binomial distribution.

     ‘NLOGL = binolike (PARAMS, X)’ returns the negative log likelihood
     of the binomial distribution with (1) parameter N and (2) parameter
     PS, given in the two-element vector PARAMS, where N is the number
     of trials and PS is the probability of success, given the number of
     successes in X.  Unlike ‘binofit’, which handles each element in X
     independently, ‘binolike’ returns the negative log likelihood of
     the entire vector X.

     ‘[NLOGL, ACOV] = binolike (PARAMS, X)’ also returns the inverse of
     Fisher’s information matrix, ACOV.  If the input parameter values
     in PARAMS are the maximum likelihood estimates, the diagonal
     elements of PARAMS are their asymptotic variances.

     ‘[...] = binolike (PARAMS, X, FREQ)’ accepts a frequency vector,
     FREQ, of the same size as X.  FREQ typically contains integer
     frequencies for the corresponding elements in X, but it can contain
     any non-integer non-negative values.  By default, or if left empty,
     FREQ = ones (size (X)).

     ‘MUHAT = expfit (X)’ returns the maximum likelihood estimate of the
     mean parameter, MUHAT, of the exponential distribution given the

     are right-censored and 0s for observations that are observed
     exactly.  Any non-zero elements are regarded as 1s.  By default, or
     if left empty, CENSOR = zeros (size (X)).

     ‘[...] = expfit (X, ALPHA, CENSOR, FREQ)’ accepts a frequency
     array, FREQ, of the same size as X.  FREQ typically contains
     integer frequencies for the corresponding elements in X, but it can
     contain any non-integer non-negative values.  By default, or if
     left empty, FREQ = ones (size (X)).

     Matlab incompatibility: Matlab’s ‘expfit’ produces unpredictable
     results for some cases with higher dimensions (specifically 1 x m x
     n x ...  arrays).  Octave’s implementation allows for nxD arrays,
     consistently performing calculations on individual column vectors.
     Additionally, CENSOR and FREQ can be used with arrays of any size,
     whereas Matlab only allows their use when X is a vector.

     A common alternative parameterization of the exponential
     distribution is to use the parameter λ defined as the mean number
     of events in an interval as opposed to the parameter μ, which is
     the mean wait time for an event to occur.  λ and μ are reciprocals,
     i.e.  μ = 1 / λ.

     Estimate parameters and confidence intervals for the generalized
     Pareto distribution.

     ‘PARAMHAT = gpfit (X, THETA)’ returns the maximum likelihood
     estimates of the parameters of the generalized Pareto distribution
     given the data in X and the location parameter THETA.  PARAMHAT(1)
     is the shape parameter, K, PARAMHAT(2) is the scale parameter,
     SIGMA, and PARAMHAT(3) is the location parameter, THETA.  Although
     THETA is returned in the estimated PARAMHAT, ‘gpfit’ does not
     estimate the location parameter THETA, and it must be assumed to be
     known, given as a fixed parameter in input argument THETA.

     ‘[PARAMHAT, PARAMCI] = gpfit (X, THETA)’ returns the 95% confidence
     intervals for the estimated parameter K and SIGMA.  The third
     colummn of PARAMCI includes the location parameter THETA without
     any confidence bounds.

     ‘[...] = gpfit (X, THETA, ALPHA)’ also returns the 100 * (1 -
     ALPHA) percent confidence intervals for the parameter estimates.
     By default, the optional argument ALPHA is 0.05 corresponding to
     95% confidence intervals.  Pass in [] for ALPHA to use the default
     values.

     ‘[...] = gpfit (X, THETA, ALPHA, OPTIONS)’ specifies control
     parameters for the iterative algorithm used to compute ML estimates
     with the ‘fminsearch’ function.  OPTIONS is a structure with the
     following fields and their default values:
        • OPTIONS.Display = "off"
        • OPTIONS.MaxFunEvals = 400
        • OPTIONS.MaxIter = 200
        • OPTIONS.TolX = 1e-6

     When K = 0 and THETA = 0, the Generalized Pareto is equivalent to
     the exponential distribution.  When K > 0 and ‘THETA = K / K’ the
     Generalized Pareto is equivalent to the Pareto distribution.  The
     mean of the Generalized Pareto is not finite when K >= 1 and the
     variance is not finite when K >= 1/2.  When K >= 0, the Generalized
     Pareto has positive density for X > THETA, or, when THETA < 0, for
     0 <= (X - THETA) / SIGMA <= -1 / K.

     Negative log-likelihood for the generalized Pareto distribution.

     ‘NLOGL = gplike (PARAMS, X)’ returns the negative log-likelihood of
     the data in X corresponding to the generalized Pareto distribution
     with (1) shape parameter K, (2) scale parameter SIGMA, and (3)
     location parameter THETA given in the three-element vector PARAMS.

     ‘[NLOGL, ACOV] = gplike (PARAMS, X)’ returns the inverse of
     Fisher’s information matrix, ACOV.  If the input parameter values
     in PARAMS are the maximum likelihood estimates, the diagonal
     elements of ACOV are their asymptotic variances.  ACOV is based on
     the observed Fisher’s information, not the expected information.

     ‘[...] = gplike (PARAMS, X, FREQ)’ accepts a frequency vector,
     FREQ, of the same size as X.  FREQ typically contains integer
     frequencies for the corresponding elements in X, but it can contain
     any non-integer non-negative values.  By default, or if left empty,
     FREQ = ones (size (X)).

     When K = 0 and MU = 0, the Generalized Pareto CDF is equivalent to
     the exponential distribution.  When K > 0 and ‘MU = K / K’ the
     Generalized Pareto is equivalent to the Pareto distribution.  The

     With no censor, the estimate of the standard deviation,
     PARAMHAT(2), is the square root of the unbiased estimate of the
     variance of log (X).  With censored data, the maximum likelihood
     estimate is returned.

     Negative log-likelihood for the lognormal distribution.

     ‘NLOGL = lognlike (PARAMS, X)’ returns the negative log-likelihood
     of the data in X corresponding to the lognormal distribution with
     (1) location parameter MU and (2) scale parameter SIGMA given in
     the two-element vector PARAMS, which correspond to the mean and
     standard deviation of the associated normal distribution.  Missing
     values, NaNs, are ignored.  Negative values of X are treated as
     missing values.

     If a random variable follows this distribution, its logarithm is
     normally distributed with mean MU and standard deviation SIGMA.

     ‘[NLOGL, AVAR] = lognlike (PARAMS, X)’ returns the inverse of
     Fisher’s information matrix, AVAR.  If the input parameter values
     in PARAMS are the maximum likelihood estimates, the diagonal
     elements of AVAR are their asymptotic variances.  AVAR is based on
     the observed Fisher’s information, not the expected information.

     ‘[...] = lognlike (PARAMS, X, CENSOR)’ accepts a boolean vector,
     CENSOR, of the same size as X with 1s for observations that are
     right-censored and 0s for observations that are observed exactly.
     By default, or if left empty, CENSOR = zeros (size (X)).

     ‘[...] = lognlike (PARAMS, X, CENSOR, FREQ)’ accepts a frequency
     vector, FREQ, of the same size as X.  FREQ typically contains
     integer frequencies for the corresponding elements in X, but it can
     contain any non-integer non-negative values.  By default, or if
     left empty, FREQ = ones (size (X)).

     Estimate parameter and confidence intervals for the negative
     binomial distribution.

     ‘PARAMHAT = nbinfit (X)’ returns the maximum likelihood estimates
     of the parameters of the negative binomial distribution given the
     data in vector X.  PARAMHAT(1) is the number of successes until the
     experiment is stopped, R, and PARAMHAT(2) is the probability of
     success in each experiment, PS.

     ‘[PARAMHAT, PARAMCI] = nbinfit (X)’ returns the 95% confidence
     intervals for the parameter estimates.

     ‘[PARAMHAT, PARAMCI] = nbinfit (X, ALPHA)’ also returns the 100 *
     (1 - ALPHA) percent confidence intervals of the estimated
     parameter.  By default, the optional argument ALPHA is 0.05
     corresponding to 95% confidence intervals.

     ‘[...] = nbinlike (PARAMS, X, FREQ)’ accepts a frequency vector,

        • OPTIONS.MaxFunEvals = 400
        • OPTIONS.MaxIter = 200
        • OPTIONS.TolX = 1e-6

     When R is an integer, the negative binomial distribution is also
     known as the Pascal distribution and it models the number of
     failures in X before a specified number of successes is reached in
     a series of independent, identical trials.  Its parameters are the
     probability of success in a single trial, PS, and the number of
     successes, R.  A special case of the negative binomial
     distribution, when R = 1, is the geometric distribution, which
     models the number of failures before the first success.

     R can also have non-integer positive values, in which form the
     negative binomial distribution, also known as the Polya
     distribution, has no interpretation in terms of repeated trials,
     but, like the Poisson distribution, it is useful in modeling count
     data.  The negative binomial distribution is more general than the
     Poisson distribution because it has a variance that is greater than
     its mean, making it suitable for count data that do not meet the
     assumptions of the Poisson distribution.  In the limit, as R
     increases to infinity, the negative binomial distribution
     approaches the Poisson distribution.

     of the negative binomial distribution with (1) parameter R and (2)
     parameter PS, given in the two-element vector PARAMS, where R is
     the number of successes until the experiment is stopped and PS is

     Estimate parameters and confidence intervals for the normal
     distribution.

     ‘[MUHAT, SIGMAHAT] = normfit (X)’ estimates the parameters of the
     normal distribution given the data in X.  MUHAT is an estimate of
     the mean, and SIGMAHAT is an estimate of the standard deviation.

     ‘[MUHAT, SIGMAHAT, MUCI, SIGMACI] = normfit (X)’ returns the 95%
     confidence intervals for the mean and standard deviation estimates
     in the arrays MUCI and SIGMACI, respectively.

        • X can be a vector or a matrix.  When X is a matrix, the
          parameter estimates and their confidence intervals are
          computed for each column.  In this case, ‘normfit’ supports
          only 2 input arguments, X and ALPHA.  Optional arguments
          CENSOR, FREQ, and OPTIONS can be used only when X is a vector.

        • ALPHA is a scalar value in the range (0,1) specifying the
          confidence level for the confidence intervals calculated as
          100x(1 – alpha)%.  By default, the optional argument ALPHA is
          0.05 corresponding to 95% confidence intervals.  Pass in []
          for ALPHA to use the default values.

        • CENSOR is a logical vector of the same length as X specifying
          whether each value in X is right-censored or not.  1 indicates
          observations that are right-censored and 0 indicates
          observations that are fully observed.  With censoring, MUHAT
          and SIGMAHAT are the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs).  If
          empty, the default is an array of 0s, meaning that all
          observations are fully observed.

        • FREQ is a vector of the same length as X and it typically
          contains non-negative integer counts of the corresponding
          elements in X.  If empty, the default is an array of 1s,
          meaning one observation per element of X.  To obtain the
          weighted MLEs for a data set with censoring, specify weights
          of observations, normalized to the number of observations in
          X.  However, when there is no censored data (default), the
          returned estimate for standard deviation is not exactly the
          WMLE. To compute the weighted MLE, multiply the value returned
          in SIGMAHAT by ‘(SUM (FREQ) - 1) / SUM (FREQ)’.  This
          correction is needed because ‘normfit’ normally computes
          SIGMAHAT using an unbiased variance estimator when there is no
          censored data.  When there is censoring in the data, the
          correction is not needed, since ‘normfit’ does not use the
          unbiased variance estimator in that case.

        • OPTIONS is a structure with the control parameters for
          ‘fminsearch’ which is used internally to compute MLEs for
          censored data.  By default, it uses the following options:
             • OPTIONS.Display = "off"
             • OPTIONS.MaxFunEvals = 400
             • OPTIONS.MaxIter = 200
