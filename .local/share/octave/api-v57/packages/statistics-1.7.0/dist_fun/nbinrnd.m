## Random arrays from the negative binomial distribution.
##
## @code{@var{rnd} = nbinrnd (@var{r}, @var{ps})} returns an array of random
## numbers chosen from the negative binomial distribution with parameters
## @var{r} and @var{ps}, where @var{r} is the number of successes until the
## experiment is stopped and @var{ps} is the probability of success in each
## experiment, given the number of failures in @var{x}.  The size of @var{rnd}
## is the common size of @var{r} and @var{ps}.  A scalar input functions as a
## constant matrix of the same size as the other inputs.
##
## When called with a single size argument, return a square matrix with
## the dimension specified.  When called with more than one scalar argument the
## first two arguments are taken as the number of rows and columns and any
## further arguments specify additional matrix dimensions.  The size may also
## be specified with a vector of dimensions @var{sz}.
##
## When @var{r} is an integer, the negative binomial distribution is also known
## as the Pascal distribution and it models the number of failures in @var{x}
## before a specified number of successes is reached in a series of independent,
## identical trials.  Its parameters are the probability of success in a single
## trial, @var{ps}, and the number of successes, @var{r}.  A special case of the
## negative binomial distribution, when @qcode{@var{r} = 1}, is the geometric
## distribution, which models the number of failures before the first success.
##
## @var{r} can also have non-integer positive values, in which form the negative
## binomial distribution, also known as the Polya distribution, has no
## interpretation in terms of repeated trials, but, like the Poisson
## distribution, it is useful in modeling count data.  The negative binomial
## distribution is more general than the Poisson distribution because it has a
## variance that is greater than its mean, making it suitable for count data
## that do not meet the assumptions of the Poisson distribution.  In the limit,
## as @var{r} increases to infinity, the negative binomial distribution
## approaches the Poisson distribution.
##
