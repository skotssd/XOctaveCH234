Executing: # Roots of a quadratic equation

The general form of a quadratic equation is :

$ax^2 + bx+c=0$

it is possible to solve for the roots (x values where y=0) using the quadratic equation.  You can also solve numerically using this script.  Just input the values for a, b and c in the code below.

This might be useful for doing assignments in CH261
